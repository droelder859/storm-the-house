# Storm The House AutoClicker

Inspired by Code Bullet's https://twitter.com/code_bullet video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fURH8z3hb6Y

## Instructions

Open a browser and go to http://www.crazygames.com/game/storm-the-house. Get to the start screen.

The python3 script `storm_the_house.py` automatically tries to find the game window.

Execute the script
```
python storm_the_house.py
```

The script starts off slow and easy, making sure to not over spend ammo.  As the levels progress it will start clicking more frequently.
