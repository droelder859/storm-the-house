## Instructions

Open a browser and go to [the game](http://www.crazygames.com/game/storm-the-house). Get to the start screen.

The python3 script `storm_the_house.py` automatically tries to find the game window.

Execute the script
```
python storm_the_house.py
```

The script starts off slow and easy, making sure to not over spend ammo.  As the levels progress it will start clicking more frequently.
